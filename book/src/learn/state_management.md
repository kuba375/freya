# State Management

Dioxus and thus Freya apps, don't have a single type of state management. 

See the different options:

- [Signals](./state_management/signals.md)
- [Global Signals](./state_management/globla_signals.md)
- [Context](./state_management/context.md)
- [Third Party](./state_management/third_party.md)
